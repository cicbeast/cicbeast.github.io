I like the movie "Let It Ride" starring Richard Dreyfus. It's a fun movie based around a nice man with a gambling problem, and a heart of
gold. At one point in the movie, there is probably the best example of Contrarian betting I've ever seen. Contrarian betting is essentially
betting 'contrary' to popular opinion. I always thought of this as assuming that the experts don't know anything.

So, when I found a dataset of Horse betting Tipsters, I thought that I'd explore the data to see just how useful/useless they might be.

I'll be analysing the data in 3 ways:
  1) Comparing the Tipsters to an average person, who I represent as choosing at random.
  2) Comparing the Tipsters to eachother, using a regression line graphing mean odds against mean results
  3) Comparing the Tipsters to eachother again, defining expertise as acheiving success betting on horses with poor odds

There will be visualizations and explanations of terminology, and hopefully some interesting results.

[UPDATE] My Project [**Blogpost**](https://medium.com/@raulgharringtonjr/thoroughly-testing-tipsters-aka-parsing-the-proficiency-of-pundits-5bd76a22c50e) and [**Code**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D_cAx1Y3hSkGVNziin5aPe0m-P60LrQ-) are both up!! Go check them out!!
