# A Project where I attempt to remove all the drama at the end of the Acadamy Awards (Spoiling Alert)

So, I love movies. If you love movies, you have to love the Oscars. It's an anual celebration of the best of artform. It breaks down all the little pieces that go into the magic of filmmaking, and then let's you know who did it best.
...Supposedly...
I say 'Supposedly' because, with VERY few exceptions, I have disagreed with the results pretty vehemently. There are, of course, a few obvious choices to be made. The Nutty Professor won 'Best Make Up', Avatar won 'Best Visual Effects', Get Out won 'Best Original Screenplay' (Yeah it was the obvious choice, Fight Me!). But honestly the Oscars are starting to feel like a toss up. At least, before the awards are handed out. The Monday morning quarterbacking is real though. 

Point in fact:

So...like any movie loving Data Scientist in Training would do, I based my project on trying to predict the Oscars. Specifically the biggest award of the evening, 'Best Film'.

I fit my model using the Oscar nominations and wins in what are considered to be the most critical (get it) categories:

  **1) Directing
    2) Writing
    3) Cinematography
    4) Editing
    5) Acting
    6) Production Design
    7) Sound**

I explored how much of an effect Wins and Nominations in these categories affect the probobality of a film winning Best Picture

My Goal is that no one ever be surprised at the end of Oscar Night ever again.My Project [**Blogpost**](https://medium.com/@raulgharringtonjr/machine-learning-at-the-oscars-ee01a84ba19e),
